## Project Computer Vision with Detectron2.

1. **Summary about project.**

   * What is Detectron2?

     > * Detectron2 is a object detection framework, which is developed and updated from first version - Detectron by Facebook Research on Feb, 2020.
     >
     > * Alongside the release of PyTorch version 1.3, Facebook released a ground-up rewrite of their framework Detectron. Detectron2 is implement in Pytorch instead of Caffe2.

   * What is RCNN algorithm?

   * What is Faster RCNN algorithm?

     > 

   * Dataset is used in project.

2. **Step by Step to implement project.**
   * We retrieve some infomation from xml file such as class(<name></name>), xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax and write them to txt file.(main.py file)
   * After that we tranform it to json.
   * Finally, we have enough data to go on to step 3.
3. **Conclusion.**
