## Project Computer Vision with Detectron2.

1. **Summary about project.**

   * What is Detectron2?

     > * Detectron2 is a object detection framework, which is developed and updated from first version - Detectron by Facebook Research on Feb, 2020.
     >
     > * Alongside the release of PyTorch version 1.3, Facebook released a ground-up rewrite of their framework Detectron. Detectron2 is implement in Pytorch instead of Caffe2.

   * What is RCNN algorithm?

   * What is Faster RCNN algorithm?

     > 

   * Dataset is used in project.

2. **Step by Step to implement project.**
   * [We retrieve some infomation from xml file such as class(<name></name>), xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax and write them to txt file.(main.py file)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFh6jefTaK8)
   * [After that we tranform it to json.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKqYt1NRx2g)
   * [Step 3, reorganize folder dataset.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn64iAAPmwY)
   * [Step 4, Let start how to train an Object Detection Model in Detectron2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-YhhaTHp9Y&t=269s)
   * [Final Step, Predict on Test dataset with Trained Model.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NqptvRi3x0&t=117s)
3. **Conclusion.**
